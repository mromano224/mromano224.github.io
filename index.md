## About Me

My name is Matthew Romano and I am currently a Junior at Lehigh University studying Finance. I have a deep interest in Fintech and learning how to use computer science platforms like Python and SQL to assist in my financial evaluations. I also have a well-rounded skill set in financial analysis, developing financial models, and performing valuation methodologies making me an ideal fit for this intern position and I am looking forward to applying what I have learned in my finance classes to real world experiences!
