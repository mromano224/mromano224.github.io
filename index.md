## About Me

My name is Matthew Romano and I am currently enrolled at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA and will complete my Bachelor of Science in Finance and with a minor in Fintech and Religious Studies in the spring of 2023. My record of schoolwork, work, and internship experiences demonstrate attributes that make me a valuable employee.
I have a deep interest in Fintech and learning how to use computer science platforms like Python and SQL to assist in my financial evaluations. I also have a well-rounded skill set in financial analysis, developing financial models, and performing valuation methodologies making me an ideal fit for this intern position and I am looking forward to applying what I have learned in my finance classes to real world experiences!
